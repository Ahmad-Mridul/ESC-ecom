#### 1) What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?
### Answer: Let's say we declared a variable named X. But somehow it doesn't have any value or assigned any value. It will be undefined. For null, we have to assign null to the variable to check something or other actions.

#### 5) Explain the concept of Scope in JavaScript (Global, Function, Block).
### Answer: A variable declared in an open space is called global scope variable. It can be used in any functions, blocks. But a variable declared in a function, won't be able to use outside of the function. It is called function scope. Sometime, we create variables in an if statement. These variable are not accessible outside of the if block and this is called block scope.
